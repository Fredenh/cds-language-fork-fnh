The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning.

            "texts:  [b'Any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn\\'t bother with an actual story, it\\'s annoying. Those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first, and the story simply tacked on. For this reason we often talk of the story \"jumping through hoops\" as it twists about, trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion.<br /><br />The story in \"Comet Over Broadway\" doesn\\'t just jump through hoops, it\\'s a three ring circus. It\\'s so ludicrous, so ill-conceived, so disingenuous that, if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen, you will be carrying on quite a rant before it\\'s through.<br /><br />The central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession. Since it\\'s all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion. So, in the end there\\'s no point to the story, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with poor screenplays, the acting doesn\\'t save a thing.'\n",
            " b'This film is a very funny film. The violence is bad, the acting is...Well Dani, stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do. The random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually-frustrated goth lads in. Personally, i think this movie really does suck. The story and characters COULD be very good, if say the directing, the actors and other little nibby things were made better. But the film is just bad, the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has Danni in it. This film is possibly the worst B-rate film ever. And, believe me that\\'s hard to achieve, especially when you\\'re competing with Def by Temptation and over crappy excuses for \"serious\" horror movies. I\\'m not a CoF fan, and so i just see this as another rubbish movie...A really bad one. If Dani made this as a comedy then, good going him. Very well done. Over than that though, i rate it low, for it\\'s crappiness. Watch it when you\\'re in a happy, happy, joy, joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you\\'re high on multiple different types of drugs.'\n",
            " b'Not many reviews, hence thought i would add one.<br /><br />DO NOT GO BY THE OTHER REVIEWS! This was a excellent movie.<br /><br />RKS is one of the very few Indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie.<br /><br />AB and Akshay given yet another example of great acting, as does bhoomika too, which was a little unexpected, but great to watch.<br /><br />Am surprised there has not been much hype around release.<br /><br />Or filmfare/other awards nominations, considering how good the movie was.<br /><br />Better then Khakee i thought and i thought Khakkee too was good movie.<br /><br />Is a fairly long movie, but definitely worth it and while watching it, definitely does seem long.<br /><br />Cant wait for RKS next movie and the next AB, Akshay movie they always seem to do well together... e.g. waqt.<br /><br />Bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future.']\n",
